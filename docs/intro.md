# The Network With Nekos

> The cat network has a very long history.
> 
> Not only as human companions but also carrying the burden of saving the world, the cats have secretly built a huge intelligence network. This network is so fast that even cats thousands of miles away can reach a consensus on an event in seconds.
>
> Soon, the cats found that the intelligence network alone was not enough, they needed massive computing power to analyze the intelligence and come up with countermeasures. Thus, the cat network took on a new and essential task: Computation.
> 
> Now, cutting-edge cryptographers among cats have developed new cryptographic technology that prevents humans from cracking their communications, thus saving the world while staying out of the way. At the same time, they drew on the **zero-knowledge proof** technique invented by humans and used it to prove that their calculations are valid.
>
> However, in the meantime, we cats soon realize that the power of cats alone is not enough. **We need human participation.** This is a tough decision since we have already decided to hide our communication under human society. If you can see this message, you must understand that **the world is in danger**. We cant tell you much about our plans, but it's important to know that, in this way, cats and humans will survive.
>
> This project, named Project Kyattsu, will be our hope.

**Kyattsu Network** is a **Decentralized Computation Platform**. It can deal with any computation that can be proved by zero-knowledge proof.

Based on the Substrate blockchain framework, we combine zero-knowledge with smart contracts, providing a computation market where people (or cats) can exchange their computational forces, freely, and without boundary.
